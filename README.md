<h1>WildGuard</h1>

<h3>Forest Fire Detection System for Uttarakhand</h3>

WildGuard is an AI-powered forest fire detection and alert system specifically designed to protect the ecologically sensitive regions of Uttarakhand. Leveraging deep learning techniques such as CNNs or YOLO, the system analyzes real-time visual data to accurately identify early signs of wildfires. Once detected, it triggers immediate alerts to relevant authorities to enable rapid response and minimize damage.

The project focuses on:

>Early fire detection using image classification and object detection models.
>Real-time alerting through integrated messaging systems.
>Scalability for deployment across various forest regions.
>Low-cost implementation using open-source tools and minimal infrastructure.
>WildGuard aims to empower forest departments and disaster management teams with a smart, proactive tool to mitigate wildfire risks and preserve biodiversity.
